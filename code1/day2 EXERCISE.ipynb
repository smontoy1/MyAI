    "Here's the scoop:\n",
    "\n",
    "The python class `OpenAI` is simply code written by OpenAI engineers that makes calls over the internet to an endpoint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `openai.chat.completions.create()`, this python code just makes a web request to the following url: \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Code like this is known as a \"client library\" - it's just wrapper code that runs on your machine to make web requests. The actual power of GPT is running on OpenAI's cloud behind this API, not on your computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI was so popular, that lots of other AI providers provided identical web endpoints, so you could use the same approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Ollama has an endpoint running on your local box at http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions  \n",
    "And in week 2 we'll discover that lots of other providers do this too, including Gemini and DeepSeek.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the team at OpenAI had a great idea: they can extend their client library so you can specify a different 'base url', and use their library to call any compatible API.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you say: `ollama_via_openai = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='ollama')`  \n",
    "Then this will make the same endpoint calls, but to Ollama instead of OpenAI."

      "Alright, I need to explain the core concepts behind language models. The main ones are neural networks, attention mechanisms, and transformers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with neural networks, I should mention how they process information. They have layers that handle different parts of the data—like embedding for words and processing sequences using RNN or CNN architectures. Maybe also touch on deep learning because LLMs use them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attention is next. It's about focusing on specific parts of the context. So in sentences, the model would highlight certain words or segments that are important to understand a sentence better than others. This helps in handling the complexity of natural language at scale by capturing contextual relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then there's the transformer architecture, which uses self-attention within each block so units can focus on any subset of its inputs. This is similar across different model sizes, making it scalable and effective for parallel processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Putting it all together, I can structure my explanation step by step, ensuring each concept is clearly linked to how they contribute to LLMs.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also keep the language simple since users might not be familiar with all technical terms, but still cover the main ideas from a core perspective.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "Language models (LLMs) are a type of machine learning model designed to predict the likelihood of a given sequence of events, such as the words in a text segment or the next token following a set of tokens. They are built on several key concepts and mechanisms that allow them to process and understand language at a general level.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Neural Networks\n",
      "\n",
      "Neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain's nervous system. They consist of layers, each composed of interconnected nodes or \"neurons\" that process and transfer information. In the context of LLMs, neural networks typically refer to deep learning-based models that house multiple layers of processing units, allowing them to capture complex patterns and relationships in data.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Embedding Layers**: These are used for discrete tokenized data (e.g., words) and generate dense vector representations from each token. This captures the semantic and syntactic properties of the text.\n",
      "- **Feed-Forward Networks**: Composed of multiple layers where information flows in one direction, typically between embedding layers and other processing regions. These layers perform nonlinear transformations on the input data.\n",
      "- **Attention Mechanisms**: A crucial component often integrated with transformers to allow models to focus not just on the entire input sequence but any specific subset.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Attention Mechanism\n",
      "\n",
      "Attention allows LLMs to understand context that is not only in a close-by window of words or tokens (like in traditional phrase-based models) but also considers arbitrary parts of the history. The basic process involves multiple layers:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Key, Query, and Value Tensors**: Each element in the model forms three tensors: one for keys, one for queries, and another for values.\n",
      "  - *Keys*: Represent the context vector (e.g., sequence or sentence).\n",
      "  - *Query*: Usually contains a single token to focus on specific information.\n",
      "  - *Values*: The output vectors from other parts of the network that contribute to the attention score.\n",
      "- **Scoring**: The dot product between query and key is computed, which determines how relevant they are to each target word or vector. This score determines whether a matching segment in the context is important for predicting a particular input part.\n",
      "- **Attention Distribution**: After computing scores (weights), the distribution of these weights over the keys is normalized by dividing by the sum of all scored vectors. This step maps these weights into probabilities, allowing LLMs to focus on relevant contexts.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. The Transformer Architecture\n",
      "\n",
      "Transformers are a class of neural networks based on the transformer model that have enabled significant advances in NLP research (Vaswaa et al., 2017). Key features:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Self-Attention**: Within each block or layer, there is self-attention, which processes all tokens at position i and outputs a distribution over these positions without any dependencies on the order of those inputs. Each token has multiple attention heads, allowing for parallel processing.\n",
      "- **Scalability**: Transformers enable parallelization, enabling models to scale with the square of input sequence length. This is done by maintaining multiple independent \" heads\" during each feed forward operation.\n",
      "- **Layer Normalization**: Following the positional and attention layers in a transformer block (as described in Vaswaa et al., 2017), layer normalization adds noise after computing features, creating an orthogonal linear transformation that stabilizes training. This technique scales by the number of parallel processing units or \"multiheads.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "### Conclusion\n",
      "\n",
      "The neural network architecture of LLMs is defined through these key components—neural networks, attention mechanisms, and transformers—that together enable models to learn and generate meaningful text.\n"
