      "✨ Longer context = Big wins: Increasing the context length from 2K to 16K gave our tiny VLMs a 60% performance boost!\n",
      "✨ Smaller is smarter with SigLIP: Surprise! Smaller LLMs didn't benefit from the usual large SigLIP (400M). Instead, we use the 80M base SigLIP that performs equally well at just 20% of the original size!\n",
      "✨ Pixel shuffling magic: Aggressively pixel shuffling helped our compact VLMs \"see\" better, achieving the same performance with sequences 16x shorter!\n",
      "✨ Learned positional tokens FTW: For compact models, learned positional tokens significantly outperform raw text tokens, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.\n",
      "✨ System prompts and special tokens are key: Introducing system prompts and dedicated media intro/outro tokens significantly boosted our compact VLM’s performance—especially for video tasks.\n",
      "✨ Less CoT, more efficiency: Turns out, too much Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data actually hurts performance in small models. They dumb\n",
      "✨ Longer videos, better results: Increasing video length during training enhanced performance on both video and image tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "🌟 State-of-the-Art Performance, SmolVLM comes in three powerful yet compact sizes—256M, 500M, and 2.2B parameters—each setting new SOTA benchmarks for their hardware constraints in image and video understanding.\n",
      "📱 Real-world Efficiency: We've created an app using SmolVLM on an iPhone 15 and got real-time inference directly from its camera!\n",
      "🌐 Browser-based Inference? Yep! We get lightning-fast inference speeds of 40-80 tokens per second directly in a web browser. No tricks, just compact, efficient models!\n",

      "\n",
      "But the core feature is just wild:  Xet uses content-defined chunking (CDC), to deduplicate at the level of bytes (~64KB chunks of data) instead of files. This means that if you change one line in a huge parquet file, Xet sees the diff on the line-level rather than the huge-file-level. Then a change takes only an instant single-line upload instead of hours to upload/download the whole file. ⚡️⚡️\n",
